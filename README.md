## Technologies Used

I've used Vue-cli, Vuex, and Axios for this project. This project mainly focused on the State Management Library. I've used the fake API from the [JsonPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/). If you want to use your own API for the Todo's data just replace the JsonPlaceholder API url to your server endpoints.
